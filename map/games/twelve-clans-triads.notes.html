                                    In Twelve Clans (a Shogun type variant heavily inspired by the Samurai Warriors series of games) fight to expand your clan and become the dominant power in Japan.
                                    As you conquer rival clans, they will become your vassals (allied to you), but your vassals' true loyalties belong only to their own clan's interests.
                                    A clan will become vassal to another for self-preservation. If another clan conquers one of your vassals, their allegiance will change to the conquering clan.
                                    However, if you are conquered, your vassals will join you in switching sides.
                                </p><br>

                                <p style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF">
                                    Once you are defeated, you simply switch sides. If one of your allies wins then you win a minor victory.
                                    Beware! No one trusts a traitor, and if you or another clan switch sides to many times, you will likely be shown no mercy should your capital fall again...
                                    There can only be one shogun. If a player conquers 7 rival clans that player achieves Total Victory, becoming the shogun. Any players who are not the first 7 to join the shogun have lost.

                                <p style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF">
                                    In the 2 (Sekigahara), 3 (Coalitions), 4 (Triads) and 6 (Bloodpact) player alliance variants included the Vassal system is removed and the traditional alliance
                                    system is in place. You can choose to play this like any other game where multiple players can be a part of any particular alliance or one player can control
                                    the entire alliance. Once a clan is taken out in these variants, they are out for good. Victory in these variants is based on alliance control of 10, 9, 8, or 8
                                    clan strongholds respectively (or all 12 if you are feeling frisky).

                                <h3 style="font-size:16px;color:F0D06B">Unit Information:</h3>
                                <p style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF">
                                    Ashigaru: Peasant recruits that are either conscripted or voluntarily join the ranks of their clan's army. Clan leaders and Nobori inspire peasants to enlist.
	                                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Cannot be purchased. Spawn from a Nobori or a Leader.<br><br>
                                    Bushi: Warriors; samurai were sometimes referred to as "Bushi" because of the prominence of the samurai class and their monopoly of the soldier role. However, bushi are simply warriors not to be confused with samurai.<br><br>
                                    Teppo: Gunners; deadly in an offensive role. Known as an anti-cavalry unit for their volley fire tactics, which were invented by Oda Nobunaga. Gunners were more expensive to deploy than archers but required less training to be as effective.<br><br>
                                    Kyudoka: Archers; make a solid defense given their high rate of fire compared to matchlock firearms. Archers also had more readily available and cheaper ammunition in the form of arrows. Generally, more skilled than a gunner in terms of training. <br><br>
                                    Ronin: Mercanaries for hire. Former samurai that have either abandoned or lost their lord. They now roam Japan looking for a way to make ends meet or to find and serve another lord.
                                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Ronin can be purchased and placed on any of your territories and do not count towards the production limit, as they are constructions. Ronin require 2 PUs upkeep per round else they will leave your service.<br><br>
                                    Nobori: Flagbearers. They are responsible for denoting units in armies and also managing troop morale. Nobori actually refers to the flag itself and not the soldier with it. The Nobori may also inspire the peasants and encourage them to enlist.
                                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Nobori spawn 2 Ashigaru every round, and give +1 defense to 10 Ashigaru. This "Resolve" Bonus does not stack on the same units.<br><br>
                                    Samurai: High ranking and highly skilled nobility that serve as retainers to the Daimyo (whom may also be samurai). Their presence on the battlefield and ability to lead inspire their troops.
                                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Samurai give a +1 attack to 10 Ashigaru. This "Courage" bonus does not stack on the same units.<br><br>
                                    Mawari: Cavalry; known for the swift charges that decimate enemy lines. Cavalry can travel quickly and carry others with them on horseback.

                                    Ninja: Also known as Shinobi, they are the spies of Japan. Ninja conduct covert operations involving espionage, deception, and assassination.
                                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Can blitz. Rolls two dice for attack and defense. Inflicts a -1 attack on 5 enemy Ashigaru. This "Fear" bonus does not stack on the same units.<br><br>
                                    Sashimono: Clan Banner. Essentially the symbol of a clan's power and influence. As you conquer territory you will see your sashimono spread. Units can be recruited from any sashimono that belongs to the player.
	                                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Acts as a factory, allowing any and all unit production up to the territory's value (except for Ronin - see above).

The Tokugawa have been squeezed between two powerful and ambitious clans: The Imagawa to the east, and the Oda to the west, a most uncomfortable position. By accepting the protection of the Imagawa, the Tokugawa only guaranteed that they were frequently attacked by the Oda. This goes some way to explaining their superior diplomatic skills, their training and use of very good kisho ninja.<br>
